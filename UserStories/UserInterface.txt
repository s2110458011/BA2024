"Requirements Engineering" for the User Interface
// what should be displayed, how and where?

------
Display loaded data in a data viewer (data grid?)
- Possible to edit here? E.g. remove columns or rows, create copys with only a subset of columns

------
Separate window for creating charts
- Choose the question(s) that should be visualized.
- Be able to choose the type of chart (within reason, preselect in BE logic which charts are sensible)
- Detailed options maybe in a separate pop up window / separate submenu that is only enabled when creating a chart?

------
Section for printing reports (as pdf) / save reports
- Possibility to write description / analysis that is added to the chart.
- Or displayed as (interactive) Dashboard?

-------
Window for opening und loading csv files from file storage location
- dialog to navigate to path and open file / load data
